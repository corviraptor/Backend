# DredgeCombat

DredgeCombat is an Origins datapack primarily focused on providing a easy-to-leverage API for sequenced abilities such as combination attacks. This enables the creation of bosses and more complicated weapons.

DredgeCombat is a datapack intended for DredgeSMP. As of this writing, this datapack is only developed and maintained by Kathrynne (corviraptor), and it lives in [her fork](https://github.com/corviraptor/Backend) of the [DredgeSMP Backend repository](https://github.com/DredgeSMP/Backend).

This datapack currently uses a separate resource pack than DredgeResources, as resource packs live in a separate directory from datapacks and I don't want to deal with source control on right now. The DredgeCombat resource pack will most likely be merged with DredgeResources when DredgeCombat is merged into the main repository.

Right now, much the documentation here represents design goals rather than implemented features. A lot of features here will likely be scrapped.
