# Loadout Tools

Loadout Tools provide customizable behavior by placing special items in their "loadout" rather than enchanting. For Loadout Tools, their appearance and tool type is determined by a Prototype weapon obtainable through quests or bartering with other players. Further behavior modifications are made using Modules like [Ability Tokens](./ability_tokens.md).

A Loadout Tool's state is entirely determined by its Loadout. Your Loadouts will remain even if the tool is not in your inventory, so you could throw the tool into a cactus, get a generic Loadout Tool, and recover your entire configuration.

## Valid Enchantments

No combat enchantments on a Prototype Loadout Tool will be transferred to the tool itself. Some combat enchantments will have equivalents and be applicable to more types of weapons (Looting on Pickaxes!), though some will remain only available through weapons that aren't Loadout Tools (Sharpness does not have a one-to-one equivalent).
