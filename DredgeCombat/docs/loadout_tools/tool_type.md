# Tool Types

Many of these might not be implemented, or may be grouped with other weapon types.

## Melee

### 🪓 Axes

Only surpassed by the spear in terms of utility on the battlefield, the Axe deals a lot of burst damage and has the weight to break defensive abilities and shields.Also cuts trees.

### ⛏ Pickaxes (unimplemented)

As effective against armor as it is stone. A weapon to reach for when conventional weaponry isn't brutal enough for your taste. Temporarily weakens armor with critical strikes, weakening targets even more the stronger their armor is.

### Hoes/Scythes/Glaives (unimplemented)

A favorite for farmers drafted into warfare. Combines the slashing and sweeping attacks of swords with the end-heavy power and reach of a polearm. Can turn a numbers disadvantage in your favor, but doesn't deal the same damage as an Axe would and lacks the agility of a sword. It still tills dirt.

### 🗡 Swords

A weapon rivaled only by the pistol for judicial dueling. Has abilities useful for defending yourself, zoning the enemy, and setting up combos.

### 🔪 Knives (unimplemented)

Ideal for the type whose primary defense is wit rather than armor. Useful for finding openings and staying mobile.

### ✀ Shears (unimplemented)

I'm not doing this.

### ⚔ Combo Blades

[Combo Blades](./comboblades.md) are dynamic weapons that switch between two Tool Types. Brutal and stylish in the same breath. Gives you a Combo Meter.
